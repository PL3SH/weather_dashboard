## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Ruby on Rails 8
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** 
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Hotwire/Turbo
  - Stimulus.js
- **APIs:**
  - OpenWeatherMap API
  - Geocoding services
- **Caching:** Rails cache with rate limiting
- **Deployment:** Docker & Kamal

## Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js & Yarn
- Docker (for deployment)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PL3SH/weather_dashboard.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

yarn install
```
3. Setup database:

```bash
rails db:create db:migrate
```

4. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Add your OpenWeatherMap API key to .env file
get you api key in https://openweathermap.org/api

```bash
rails credentials:edit
```
    Inside the credentials file, add your API key under a namespace. For example:

```yaml
api_keys:
  my_service: "your-secret-api-key"
```

    Never commit master.key to Git!. It should be in .gitignore by default.

5. Start the server:
```bash
bin/dev
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`: Your OpenWeatherMap API key

# Service class for interacting with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and store weather data.
#
# This service handles API requests to OpenWeatherMap, including rate limiting and data parsing.
# It uses HTTParty for making HTTP requests and Rails.cache for rate limiting.
#
# @example Fetching weather for a location
#   service = WeatherService.new
#   weather = service.fetch_weather(location)
#
class WeatherService
    include HTTParty
    base_uri 'api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5' 
    
    # Initializes the WeatherService with API credentials
    #
    # @return [WeatherService] a new instance of WeatherService
    def initialize
      @api_key = Rails.application.credentials.openweather[:api_key]
    end
    
    # Fetches current weather data for a given location
    #
    # Makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap and creates a new WeatherRecord
    # if the request is successful and within rate limits.
    #
    # @param location [Location] the location to fetch weather for
    # @return [WeatherRecord, nil] the created weather record or nil if the request fails
    # @example
    #   location = Location.find(1)
    #   weather_record = service.fetch_weather(location)
